## Description

- My main goal in this was to add a proper working for loop but no matter what i tried i could not get to work, so eventually i faound another way to randomize the strings.
- This proect is a great way to obtain a random password and i might use it in the future!
- This project i could share with friends/family if they ever need a quick password generator
- IN the end i learned a lot about how the stuff works
